Hi I'm Craig, thanks for stopping by and welcome to my little area of the internet.

I currently work for a Christian charity organisation in a small IT team of 3 supporting a staff team of approximately 50. I focus primarily on:

* Windows deployment, configuration and maintenance
* Application packaging and deployment

I enjoy learning, sharing what I have learnt and helping others. I also have a drive for continuous improvement of efficiency through automation and following convention over configuration.

Recent projects I have worked on include:

* Migrating staff team from on-premise Windows 8.1 Hyper-V virtual desktops to laptops running Windows 10, version 1909
* Migrating staff team from on-premise Exchange Server 2013 to Microsoft 365
* Migrating product meta data and digital asset files from SQL server to a SaaS Digital Asset Management platform automating the data ingest process through their API

Outside of work, I'm a husband and father to a toddler. In my spare time when I'm not helping friends and family with their IT or running the Church A/V (currently over Zoom) on a Sunday morning, I can sometimes be found practising Tai-chi and Kung-fu.

Thanks again for visiting, I hope you find something here helpful!

Take care and enjoy,<br/>
Craig
